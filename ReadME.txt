My tool is a voice enhanced calculator named Voice Calculator.
The tool makes use of google voice recognition to capture various numerics and conduct various arithmetic.
To use the google voice option you just press the voice button and the voice window will prompt.
Example of arithmetic operations using voice recogntion:

1."two plus two equals" prompts 2+2=Answer
2."two minus two equals" prompts 2-2=Answer
3."two times two equals" prompts 2*2=Answer
4."two divided by two equals" prompts 2/2=Answer

The application recognises

 1.("add" as "+")
 2.("sub or minus" as"-")
 3.(" plus" as "+")
 4.(" minus" as "-")
 5.(" times  or into or in2 or multiply by" as "*")
 6.("equals or equal" as "=")
 7.(" divide by or divide" as "/")
